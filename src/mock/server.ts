// Very small mock endpoint for development. You can run a local static server to serve `data/sample_reports.json` or implement a simple Express server.
// This file is a placeholder showing how the frontend expects the API shape.

// Example responses expected by frontend:
// GET /reports?imo=1234567 -> { total, limit, offset, results: ReportSummary[] }
// GET /reports/rep_2025_001 -> Report

// Use your own tooling (json-server, express) to serve `data/sample_reports.json` if you want a dev API.
