Logs folder: store inspection logs exported or received from API as JSON files.

Naming convention: `<imo>_<date>.json` (e.g. `9200671_24_12_2025.json`).

This folder is intended for manual or automated log storage; update server or client code to write to this directory if you want programmatic persistence.
